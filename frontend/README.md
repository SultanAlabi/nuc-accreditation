## 💻 Frontend Setup & Startup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Configure environment variables (.env)
# Create a .env file inside frontend/ directory (see template below)

# 4. Run local development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend client will boot up and be accessible locally on: **`http://localhost:5173`**.

## 🔒 Environment Variables (`frontend/.env`)

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory to configure your backend API target:

```ini
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

---

## 🤝 API Service Layer Integration

The React app communicates with the backend via `src/services/api.js`. The client is equipped with automatic request/response interceptors to:
1. Automatically read the stored user token (`nuc_token`) and attach it as a `Bearer` token to all outgoing requests.
2. Intercept `401 Unauthorized` responses to cleanly log out invalid sessions and redirect back to `/login`.

The following services are mapped out of the box:
- **`authAPI`**: Register, Login, Logout, fetch current user info.
- **`programmesAPI`**: CRUD for academic programmes.
- **`milestonesAPI`**: Mark milestones as completed.
- **`documentsAPI`**: Fetch global library, upload programme files, verify evidence, or delete documents.
- **`notificationsAPI`**: Fetch alerts, mark single/all as read, dismiss.
- **`settingsAPI`**: Change password, preferences, profile edits, deactivation.
- **`teamAPI`**: Manage panel members and send team invites.
